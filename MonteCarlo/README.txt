Make sure you have python installed on the machine this is running on
Open to where you have the documents stored in your file explorer
You can run these python scripts in any fashion, but here is how I do it:
In your file explorer window, in the address bar where it has the path to these files type cmd and it
will open a cmd prompt with the directory of where these files are
to run either program type: python3 ./CustomRNG.py 
or type: python3 ./MonteCarlo.py
